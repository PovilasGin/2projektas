    <p style="background-color: gray">The topic of <b>SARMs</b> (or selective androgen receptor modulators) have been a controversial one since the early 90s when they were first introduced in mainstream science. Now this isn’t to say that SARMs haven’t been around long before this period. In the 1940s, steroidal SARMs have been used for medical use in multiple diseases including cancer, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, and a number of other diseases that affect muscle and bone wasting. These SARMs had a very strong effect on muscle building due to its “high affinity”, which in non-scientific terms means it’s attraction to a receptor is high and that is what makes a chemical reaction in the body more powerful.</p>

            <td>As we age, our endurance, power and skeletal muscle mass deteriorates due to the loss of type 2 muscle fibers. This hinders individuals to function normally. With SARMS, skeletal muscle mass and strength in androgen-deficient people can be enhanced.There are 2 types of administering SARMS – orally or in injectable dosages. The anabolic effect is expected to be the same as testosterone. Moreover, it’s also said to produce dose-dependent improvements in bone mineral density and motorized strength apart from the ability to decrease body fat and increase lean body mass.
